# HR Time — P0 closure slices roadmap

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Surface | `docs-V2/_scratch/erp/time-slices-roadmap.md` |
| Mode | Scratch ops — implementation sequencing (spec) |
| Audience | Engineers implementing `@afenda/human-resources` Time |
| Authority | [time.md](./time.md) §22 P0 · §11–§12 · §18 · §23 · final boundary (§1254) |
| Parent roadmap | [human-resources-roadmap.md](./human-resources-roadmap.md) — HR9 / HR10 |
| Baseline snapshot | 2026-07-23 — 52 focused memory scenarios green; 20/20 shared memory contracts green, including every §23 row: fixed/overnight/flexible/split shifts, controlled schedule amendment and attendance lock, manual capture, mixed import failure/replay convergence, DST elapsed-time resolution, representative foreign mutation isolation, the complete 12-type exception matrix, calendar override matrix, overnight multi-break and differing-timezone session, append-only attendance-correction provenance with failure compensation and serialized rollback/concurrent retry, approved-leave absence suppression/control-day detection and paid-leave handoff, complete draft edit/remove → return → reopen → approve → lock timesheet lifecycle with immutable locked entries and versioned post-lock handoff, controlled approved-timesheet supersession into a distinct correction draft, security/stale-version/idempotency boundaries and the overtime minute lifecycle; the same 20 explicitly gated Drizzle contracts await the authorized production migration |
| Lifecycle | **HR10 in progress** — authoritative open-gap ledger: [time-remaining.md](./time-remaining.md) |

**Why this file:** [time.md](./time.md) is **what** (requirements). [human-resources-roadmap.md](./human-resources-roadmap.md) HR10 is the **phase**. This document is **how/when** to close the verified P0 gaps without tables-only drift.

---

## Goals

1. Close every **P0 mandatory** item in [time.md §22](./time.md) with disk evidence (commands, store, DDL, permissions, events, tests).
2. Follow [time.md final boundary](./time.md): align command surface, store contract, adapter, permissions, audit/outbox, and payroll handoff **before** optional-table expansion.
3. Ship in **one-mission-per-chat** slices with pasted verify commands.

## Non-goals

- P1 capabilities in [time.md §22](./time.md) (`shift swapping`, `open-shift bidding`, geofencing, biometric connectors, roster optimization).
- Payroll gross-to-net, rate calculation, or `@afenda/payroll` peer imports inside HR.
- Living `docs/` controlled bodies (Docs-lane dormant).
- Product UI features/routes beyond minimal `apps/web` Server Actions where a slice explicitly includes them.

## Constraints (hard stops)

| Stop | Rule |
| ---- | ---- |
| No shims | Real store + Drizzle + memory parity per slice — no throw-TODO commands |
| No tables-only | DDL changes must land with store + commands + tests in the same slice (or HR-TIME-P0-01 decision-only slice) |
| Tenancy | Every new/changed `hr_*` root → `hard-tenant-roots.ts` + `pnpm audit:tenancy-nulls` |
| Events | New domain events → `@afenda/events` schema + `module.manifest` `emits` + emission registry |
| Leave boundary | Time consumes approved leave via port — never approves leave or mutates balances |
| Permission prefix | Implement `human-resources.time.*` (disk convention); amend [time.md §17](./time.md) labels in a docs-only note if `hr.time.*` shorthand is retained for readability |

---

## Baseline — what HR10 already shipped (2026-07-23)

Verified on disk (do not re-implement):

| Layer | Evidence |
| ----- | -------- |
| Package API | `packages/erp/human-resources/src/time/**` exported from `src/index.ts` |
| Store contract | `packages/erp/human-resources/src/store/time.ts` (`HumanResourcesTimeStore`) |
| Adapters | `adapters/memory/time.ts`, `adapters/drizzle/time.ts` (composed in `adapters/drizzle/store.ts`) |
| DDL | `0001_hr_work_calendar.sql`, `0002_hr_time.sql`; pending governed expansion in `0006_hr_time_policy.sql`; Drizzle schema `human-resources.ts` |
| Commands (core) | Calendar, shift, scheduling, attendance, sessions, exceptions (review), timesheet lifecycle, overtime, handoff query |
| Permissions | `platform-permission-catalog.ts` — `human-resources.time.*` (+ legacy `human-resources.timesheet.approve`) |
| Tests | `human-resources.time.test.ts` — **52/52 memory pass**; `human-resources.time.parity.test.ts` — **20/20 shared memory contracts pass**, including every §23 row: fixed/overnight/flexible/split shifts with ordered breaks/segments, controlled schedule amendment and post-attendance immutability, manual capture, mixed import failure/replay convergence, DST elapsed-time resolution, representative foreign assignment/timesheet-entry/overtime mutation isolation, every declared attendance exception, normal/holiday/half-day/replacement calendars, overnight multi-break and differing-timezone session resolution, append-only attendance-correction provenance with immutable capture facts, exact version/reason/evidence/correlation history, failure compensation and serialized rollback/concurrent retry, approved-leave absence suppression with a no-leave control day, idempotent leave generation and paid-leave handoff, complete timesheet draft edit/remove → return → reopen → approve → lock behavior with locked mutation denial and incremented handoff version, controlled approved-timesheet supersession into a distinct correction draft with immutable original facts, create replay/fingerprint conflict, stale-version rejection, self-approval denial and requested/approved/actual/payroll overtime-minute separation, with the same 20 Drizzle counterparts guarded by `REQUIRE_DATABASE_TESTS=1` and blocked until `0006_hr_time_policy.sql` is explicitly authorized/applied; `effective-lineage.test.ts` — **6/6 fail-closed lineage contracts pass**; `hr-time-migration.test.ts` — **4/4 static migration contracts pass**; `hr-time-actions.test.ts` — **16/16 permission/session/validation contracts pass** |
| Web (minimal) | `apps/web/app/actions/hr-time.ts` — 26 permission-gated actions |
| Single outbox event | `human-resources.timesheet.approved.v1` on approve path |

## Current reconciliation

The original P0-01…P0-08 plan is no longer the complete gap view. The post-implementation audit and closure status live in [time-remaining.md](./time-remaining.md):

- closed: governance/hygiene, timesheet-field parity, split-shift segments;
- implemented but production-schema-blocked: full exception detection and Time policy lookup;
- closed since the original audit: effective-dated Time-policy/calendar/shift successor lineage with unrelated same-code isolation and fail-closed malformed-lineage handling; effective-dated actor approval authority; configurable ordered timesheet approvals with exact authority-grant provenance, resubmission isolation, event sequencing and compensation evidence; immutable evidence-only break-waiver decisions; safe legacy-submission conversion in the pending migration; and complete policy/authority/waiver Action adapters.
- still open: multi-scope calendar precedence, cross-midnight break/legal-date allocation, and production-backed execution of the 20 shared Drizzle contracts plus the tenancy audit.

Do not interpret the historical slice sequence below as a completion claim.

**Accepted divergences (unless HR-TIME-P0-01 reopens):**

- `archiveWorkCalendar` instead of activate/deactivate pair.
- `work_week_json` on `hr_work_calendar` instead of `hr_work_calendar_week_pattern`.
- `hr_work_calendar_holiday` instead of generic `hr_work_calendar_date_override` table.
- `publishShiftAssignment` (per assignment) instead of batch `publishSchedule`.
- `createOvertimeRequest` / `lockTimesheet` naming vs plan shorthand.

## Slice dependency graph

```text
HR-TIME-P0-01 (calendar override decision + DDL if needed)
  └─► HR-TIME-P0-02 (command/query alignment)
        ├─► HR-TIME-P0-03 (leave port — requires HR11 leave on disk ✅)
        ├─► HR-TIME-P0-05 (import port — can parallel after P0-02 store hooks)
        └─► HR-TIME-P0-06 (exception detection)
              └─► HR-TIME-P0-04 (events/registry — after mutation surface stable)
                    └─► HR-TIME-P0-07 (§23 test matrix)
                          └─► HR-TIME-P0-08 (web + permission cleanup)
```

**Parallel rule:** HR-TIME-P0-03 and HR-TIME-P0-05 may run in separate chats once HR-TIME-P0-02 merges; HR-TIME-P0-04 must follow stable command ids.

## Slices (one Agent chat each)

Pattern per slice: **decision/DDL (if any) → store → commands/queries → memory + Drizzle → manifest ids + auth map → tests → verify commands**.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Depends on** | HR-TIME-P0-02 (final command ids) |
| **Closes** | [time.md §18](./time.md) material mutations; registry parity |
| **In scope** | Event types (disk naming: `human-resources.time.*.v1` or align to plan `hr.time.*` — pick one prefix in this slice): `schedule.published`, `attendance.recorded`, `attendance.corrected`, `exception.created`, `timesheet.submitted`, `timesheet.reopened`, `timesheet.locked`, `overtime.approved`, `payroll_handoff.ready` (+ keep `timesheet.approved`). Expand `mutation-emission-registry.ts` for **all** time mutation commands. Extend `correlation-integrity.test.ts` fixtures. Drizzle `emitOutbox` on happy paths (mirror leave/employee patterns). |

| **Closes** | [time.md §2.6](./time.md) detection; P0 “attendance exceptions” completeness |
| **In scope** | Detection hooks: late, early departure, missing clock-in/out, unscheduled attendance, schedule mismatch (compare session to `hr_shift_assignment`). Invoke on `resolveAttendanceSession` and/or schedule publish. Tests: §23 Exceptions + Session rows. |
| **Out of scope** | Union rule engines; geofencing |

| **In scope** | Expand `human-resources.time.test.ts` + parity suite: schedule conflict rejection, break pairing, overnight session, correction retains original event, timesheet generate/return/reopen, overtime request→approve→actual→verify, timezone divergence, stale `expectedVersion`, cross-org (extend), Drizzle parity for new scenarios. |
| **Out of scope** | New product features beyond §23 |
| **Deliverables** | Test files only (plus minimal bug fixes if tests expose defects) |
| **Verify** | `pnpm --filter @afenda/human-resources test -- human-resources.time` · `pnpm exec turbo run typecheck --filter=@afenda/human-resources` |
| **Done when** | Every §23 table row maps to ≥1 automated test (memory); parity covers critical path |

| --- | --- |
| **Depends on** | HR-TIME-P0-07 |
| **Closes** | [time.md §17](./time.md); operator/self-service entry points |
| **In scope** | Catalog: add `human-resources.time.attendance.manage` if supervisor-entered attendance is distinct from `correct`. Migrate `approveTimesheetAction` to `human-resources.time.timesheet.approve` (deprecate legacy code path with catalog seed migration note). `apps/web/app/actions/hr-time.ts`: calendar CRUD, schedule publish, clock-out/breaks, exception resolve, overtime request, generate entries, handoff — each with `runOperatorPermissionAction` + `createHumanResourcesCommandOptions()`. |

## HR10 completion checklist

Mark HR10 **DONE** in [human-resources-roadmap.md](./human-resources-roadmap.md) only when all rows are ✅:

| # | Criterion | Slice |
| - | --------- | ----- |
| 1 | Calendar override scenarios tested | P0-01 |
| 2 | §11–§12 P0 commands/queries on disk | P0-02 |
| 3 | Leave port wired; false absence suppressed | P0-03 |
| 4 | §18 events + full emission registry | P0-04 |
| 5 | Import port + idempotent external events | P0-05 |
| 6 | Auto exception detection | P0-06 |
| 7 | §23 matrix green (memory + drizzle parity) | P0-07 |
| 8 | Permissions + web actions aligned | P0-08 |
| 9 | `pnpm audit:tenancy-nulls` — all time roots | every DDL slice |
| 10 | No peer `@afenda/payroll` imports in HR package | always |

---

## Verify commands (standard floor)

Run at end of **every** slice and paste evidence in chat:

```bash
pnpm --filter @afenda/human-resources test -- human-resources.time
pnpm --filter @afenda/human-resources typecheck
pnpm audit:tenancy-nulls
pnpm governance:packages
```

When touching events/registry:

```bash
pnpm --filter @afenda/human-resources test -- emission-registry correlation-integrity
pnpm --filter @afenda/events test
```

When touching web actions:

```bash
pnpm --filter @afenda/web typecheck
```

## Open questions (resolve in HR-TIME-P0-01 chat)

| # | Question | Default if no answer |
| - | -------- | -------------------- |
| 1 | Extend `hr_work_calendar_holiday` vs new `hr_work_calendar_date_override` table? | Extend holiday + `override_kind` enum (smaller migration) |
| 2 | Event prefix: `human-resources.time.*` vs plan `hr.time.*`? | Keep `human-resources.*` disk convention; note in time.md §18 |
| 3 | Batch `publishSchedule` in P0? | **No** — per-assignment publish remains; batch = P1 |
| 4 | `human-resources.timesheet.approve` vs `human-resources.time.timesheet.approve`? | Consolidate on `human-resources.time.timesheet.approve` in P0-08 |
