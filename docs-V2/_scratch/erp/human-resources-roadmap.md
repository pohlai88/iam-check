# Human Resources development roadmap

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Surface | `docs-V2/_scratch/erp/human-resources-roadmap.md` |
| Mode | Scratch ops — agent sequencing |
| Bounded context | `@afenda/human-resources` only |
| Architecture authority | [human-resource.md](./human-resource.md) |
| Scaffold authority | [SCAFFOLDING.md](../../packages/erp/SCAFFOLDING.md) |
| Reference implementation | `packages/erp/sales/src/` |
| Baseline snapshot | 2026-07-21 — `lifecycle: scaffolded` |

**Why a separate file:** [human-resource.md](./human-resource.md) is bounded-context architecture (what/why). This document is **how/when** — phased slices, verify commands, and Path to 100%. Do not duplicate the architecture body here.

---

## Executive summary

`@afenda/human-resources` is **governance-complete at scaffold** (43 mutation tables, 16 events, 20 permissions, folder markers) but **behavior-empty** (zero commands/queries, empty store, empty authorization map, minimal DDL columns). Payroll remains a **downstream consumer** via events and app-injected ports — never peer-imported from HR.

Phases **HR0–HR16** walk scaffolded → enterprise production compliance. Phases **HR9 (GATE-TL)** and **HR12–HR13** resolve the deliberate gap: `src/time/`, `leave/`, `performance/`, `talent/` exist on disk and aggregates are listed in `mutation-tables.ts`, but **no `hr_*` DDL** for those domains appears in scratch §2–§5 or the 43-table manifest.

**`lifecycle: active` flip** happens only in **HR16** after SCAFFOLDING §3 non-negotiables are met (manifest command/query ids, authorization maps, `Result<T>` public API, domain tests, app composition root). Until then the catalog stays `scaffolded`.

---

## Hard stops (every phase)

| Stop | Rule |
| ---- | ---- |
| Peer ERP imports | No `@afenda/payroll`, `@afenda/payments`, `@afenda/accounting` in `packages/erp/human-resources` |
| Payroll boundary | No gross-to-net, no `payroll_*` writes, no payslip calculation in HR |
| Finance boundary | No `payment`, `journal`, `journal_line` writes from HR |
| Shims | No throw-TODO commands, no empty store pretending to persist |
| Master data | Reference `md_party` / masters via lookup port — no shadow employee vendor tables |
| Integration | Cross-module effects via `OutboxPort` + `apps/web` saga — not package imports |

---

## Gap matrix — scaffold vs scratch vs SCAFFOLDING

| Dimension | On disk today | Scratch target | SCAFFOLDING § expectation | Gap |
| --------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- | --- |
| **Package folder** | `packages/erp/human-resources/` | Same | Minimal transactional layout | ✅ Present |
| **Manifest** | `lifecycle: scaffolded`; 43 tables; 16 emits; auth maps `{}` | `lifecycle: active` when ready | Commands/queries + auth maps required for `active` | ❌ Commands/queries/auth |
| **Mutation tables** | 43 `hr_*` (core → C&B) | Same 43 in scratch §2–§5 | Parity with SCHEMA-OWNERSHIP-MANIFEST | ✅ Registered |
| **Time / leave / perf / talent DDL** | Folder markers only; aggregates in manifest list | Folders in §1 structure; **no table list in §2–§5** | Sole-mutator tables in manifest + DDL | ⚠️ **GATE-TL** — design before implement |
| **DDL columns** | `createErpScaffoldTable` (id, org, timestamps) | Full domain columns per aggregate | Real columns before production commands | ❌ All 43 tables |
| **Store** | Empty `HumanResourcesStore` | `store.ts` + memory + drizzle | Persistence abstraction | ❌ |
| **Commands / queries** | `module-ids.ts` → `[]` | Full capability per domain | `Result<T>` public API | ❌ |
| **Events** | 16 ids in `@afenda/events` + manifest | §9 event list | Append on mutation TX | ✅ Catalog; ❌ emitters |
| **Permissions** | 20 codes in package + PERMISSION-REGISTER | §10 permission list | Manifest auth map per cmd/qry | ✅ Codes; ❌ maps |
| **Tenancy audit** | 43 roots in ownership manifest | Hard `organization_id` | `hard-tenant-roots.ts` + `audit:tenancy-nulls` | ✅ HR1 DONE — 43/43 registered |
| **App wiring** | `human-resources-authorization-port.ts` only | Actions + features per domain | `*-command-options.ts` + Actions | ❌ No command-options / Actions / features |
| **Payroll consumer** | `optionalIntegratesWith: payroll (events)` | `PayrollEmployeeQueryPort` owned by payroll | App adapter from HR queries | ❌ Port + adapter (payroll package) |
| **Module readiness** | No Living `*-MOD-009/010` | Enterprise evidence | `afenda-elite-module-readiness` | **BLOCKED** — Docs-lane dormant |

### GATE-TL authority citation (time / leave / performance / talent)

| Source | What it says |
| ------ | ------------ |
| [human-resource.md §1 structure](./human-resource.md) | Physical folders `time/`, `leave/`, `performance/`, `talent/` are **in scope** as nested capabilities |
| [human-resource.md §2–§5](./human-resource.md) | **Suggested mutation tables** cover core, recruitment, lifecycle, learning, C&B only — **43 tables** |
| `mutation-tables.ts` | Lists time/leave/perf/talent **aggregates** but **not** matching `hr_*` table names |
| [human-resource.md §9–§10](./human-resource.md) | Events `leave.approved`, `timesheet.approved` + permissions `leave.*`, `attendance.*`, `timesheet.*`, `performance.manage` imply **future** capability without DDL |
| **Roadmap rule** | **HR9** must amend scratch with explicit table list + manifest expansion **before** HR10–HR13 write DDL or commands |

**Defer option (explicit):** HR12–HR13 may remain `DEFERRED` on MODULE-ROADMAP until product prioritizes perf/talent; HR10–HR11 (time/leave) are **required** before payroll input consumption is credible.

---

### HR9 — GATE-TL: Time / leave / performance / talent DDL design

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Depends on** | HR8 |

Time:     hr_shift, hr_attendance_event, hr_attendance_record, hr_timesheet,
          hr_attendance_exception
Leave:    hr_leave_policy, hr_leave_entitlement, hr_leave_request, hr_leave_adjustment
Performance (defer ok): hr_performance_cycle, hr_goal, hr_review, hr_improvement_plan
Talent (defer ok):      hr_competency, hr_talent_profile, hr_talent_pool,
          hr_succession_plan, hr_career_plan
```

| **Verify** | Human review of scratch PR; `pnpm governance:packages` after manifest table list updated |

---

### HR10 — Time & attendance

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Depends on** | HR9 (time tables approved) |
| **In scope** | DDL migration + store + attendance/timesheet commands; emit `timesheet.approved.v1` |

---

### HR12 — Performance management `[DEFER ok]`

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Depends on** | HR9 (perf tables approved; skip if deferred) |
| **In scope** | Cycles, goals, reviews, improvement plans |
| **Defer authority** | Scratch §1 lists capability; no payroll dependency — defer if MODULE-ROADMAP prioritizes payroll first |
| **Verify** | `pnpm --filter @afenda/human-resources test` |
| **Done when** | Review cycle close emits audit; no journal side effects |

---

### HR13 — Talent management `[DEFER ok]`

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Depends on** | HR9 (talent tables approved; skip if deferred) |
| **In scope** | Competency, profiles, pools, succession, career plans |
| **Defer authority** | Same as HR12 |
| **Verify** | `pnpm --filter @afenda/human-resources test` |
| **Done when** | Talent data stays HR-scoped; no separate `@afenda/learning` package |

---

### HR14 — Payroll consumer surface (HR side complete)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Depends on** | HR7 + HR11 (compensation agreements + leave approvals) |
| **In scope** | HR **query** commands needed by `PayrollEmployeeQueryPort` (scratch §7); document event payloads for payroll |
| **Out of scope** | Implementing `@afenda/payroll` package |
| **Reference** | Scratch §7 `PayrollEmployeeQueryPort` — interface lives in **payroll** package when built |
| **Verify** | Contract test in HR package asserting stable read DTO for payroll adapter |
| **Done when** | App can implement payroll adapter without HR source imports |

---

### HR15 — App composition root + first Actions

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Depends on** | HR6 minimum (lifecycle path); ideally HR11 |
| **In scope** | `apps/web/lib/erp/human-resources-command-options.ts`; Actions for core lifecycle path; optional `features/human-resources/` shell |
| **Out of scope** | Full UI for every aggregate |
| **Reference** | `apps/web/lib/erp/sales-command-options.ts` · `apps/web/app/actions/create-sales-order.ts` |
| **Verify** | `pnpm --filter @afenda/web typecheck` · targeted `pnpm test -- apps/web/__tests__/*human-resources*` |
| **Done when** | ≥1 Server Action calls HR package with `ActionResult`; permission strings match catalog |

---

### HR16 — `lifecycle: active` + Path to 100%

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Depends on** | HR15 + all non-deferred domain phases |
| **In scope** | Flip `lifecycle: active` in manifest + `validate:modules --write`; complete authorization maps for **all** shipped command/query ids; README consume section lists real commands |
| **Out of scope** | Living MOD-009/010 bodies (Docs-lane) |
| **Verify** | Full gate block below |
| **Done when** | See **Lifecycle active — definition of done** |

---

## Lifecycle active — definition of done

Per [SCAFFOLDING.md §3](../../packages/erp/SCAFFOLDING.md) and §9 checklist:

| Criterion | Evidence |
| --------- | -------- |
| `lifecycle: active` in manifest + MODULE-CATALOG | `pnpm validate:modules --write` |
| Every shipped command/query in manifest `owns` | `module-ids.ts` parity test |
| Every shipped id in `authorization.commands` / `queries` | manifest test |
| Public API returns `Result<T>` | package tests |
| No peer ERP imports | `manifest.test.ts` + `pnpm governance:packages` |
| Tenancy | `pnpm audit:tenancy-nulls` |
| Governance | `pnpm governance:packages` |
| Package quality | `pnpm --filter @afenda/human-resources lint typecheck test` |
| App wiring | `pnpm --filter @afenda/web typecheck` + Action tests |
| Anti-goals honored | No `payroll_*` / `payment` / `journal` writes in HR package grep |

**Not required for `active`:** HR12–HR13 if explicitly deferred in HR9 with scratch note. **Required for payroll credibility:** HR7, HR10, HR11, HR14.

## Path to 100% — SCAFFOLDING §9 mapping

| §9 Step | Artifact | HR phase | Status @ baseline |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| 1 | MODULE-ROADMAP.yaml row | HR0 | **Gap** — add row when implementing HR1 |
| 2 | `packages/erp/human-resources/` + package.json | HR0 | ✅ |
| 3 | `module.manifest.ts` complete | HR16 | ⚠️ scaffolded |
| 4 | Schema + migration in `@afenda/db` | HR2–HR11 | ⚠️ scaffold columns only |
| 5 | WORKSPACE-EDGE-REGISTER edges | HR0 | ✅ (`@afenda/db`, events, audit, master-data) |
| 6 | CATALOG_EXPECTED_PACKAGES / validate-modules | HR16 | ⚠️ lifecycle mismatch |
| 7 | Permission catalog seeds + auth map | HR3+ per slice | ⚠️ codes only |
| 8 | Domain tests + Action wiring | HR3–HR15 | ❌ |
| 9 | Package README | HR16 | ⚠️ consume section TBD |
| 10 | `pnpm governance:packages` + lint/typecheck/test | Every phase | ✅ baseline passes |

### Module readiness evidence (MOD-002)

| Evidence row | Status | Notes |
| ------------ | ------ | ----- |
| Living `human-resources-MOD-009` | **BLOCKED** | Docs-lane dormant — record BLOCKED in scratch until reopen |
| Living `human-resources-MOD-010` claim | **BLOCKED** | No `PASS` without Living packs |
| `pnpm check:module-quality` | **BLOCKED** | Same |
| Independent enterprise claim | After HR16 + Docs-lane | Use `afenda-elite-module-readiness` |

---

## Verify command templates (all phases)

```bash
# Package gate (every implementation phase)
pnpm --filter @afenda/human-resources lint typecheck test

# Monorepo governance (manifest, edges, registers)
pnpm governance:packages

# After manifest or table ownership edits
pnpm validate:modules --write

# After new tenant roots or DDL
pnpm audit:tenancy-nulls

# After permission code changes
pnpm --filter @afenda/db db:ensure-permission-catalog

# After app Actions (HR15+)
pnpm --filter @afenda/web typecheck
pnpm test -- apps/web/__tests__/*human-resources*
```
